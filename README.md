The about page contains information about my career and programming experience, and utilizes an ordered list.

The objective page utilizes a table, as well as CSS pseudo-elements to place the checkmarks in the class 'complete'.

The stylesheet covers multiple CSS properties and selectors, including the use of class and ID selectors.
